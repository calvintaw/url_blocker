# 🔒 Smart Malicious URL Detector

A minimal, privacy-friendly Chrome Extension to block malicious or distracting websites. It redirects users to a custom `warning.html` page when they visit a blocked site.

> 🛠️ Made as a free alternative to BlockSite, which limits to 2 rules unless you pay (which triggered me). This tool gives you full control with no cost (downside: less features).
